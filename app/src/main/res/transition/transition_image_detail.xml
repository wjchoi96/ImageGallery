    changeImageTransform
    This Transition captures an ImageView's matrix before and after the scene change and animates it during the transition
    In combination with ChangeBounds, ChangeImageTransform allows ImageViews that change size, shape, or ImageView.ScaleType to animate contents smoothly.

    changeBounds
    This transition captures the layout bounds of target views before and after the scene change and animates those changes during the transition.
